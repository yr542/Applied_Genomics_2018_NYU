Additional instructor's comments about your submission:

Part 1. (-4) Your command also counted features like "pseudogene".

Interesting use of csplit. This is probably an easier way:

grep ">" Scer3.fa | wc -l

grep counts the number of times ">" appears in the file, and you pipe that to wc with the -l option (which counts the number of lines it occurs).

Well done.
