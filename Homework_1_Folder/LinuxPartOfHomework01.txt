##This part was done in command line and then copied into a Notepad ++ document.

#########Question(s):

### 1. Create a directory called Homework01 in your scratch directory and copy the three files there.
## The hashtags are comments the commands do not have hashtags on it.
## First I have to go to the SCRATCH Directory
cd $SCRATCH
## Make a directory called Homework01
mkdir Homework01
##Copy the files needed into the folder
cp /scratch/courses/AppliedGenomics2018/Homework01/cdg21c1_R1.fastq .
#Move the file to Homework01
mv cdg21c1_R1.fastq Homework01
#Copy the file of interest
cp /scratch/courses/AppliedGenomics2018/Homework01/Scer3.fa .
#Move it
mv Scer3.fa Homework01
#Go to where you want
cd $SCRATCH/Homework01
#Check
pwd
ls
#Copy the file of interest
cp /scratch/courses/AppliedGenomics2018/Homework01/Scer3.gff .
##Checking everything is in the file
ls


### 2.  How many sequences are provided in the Scer3.fa file and what are their names?

## From the Scer.fa file I found 17 sequences.I used the following code.
##I made a directory. I had already made a Q2 directory and cd commanded into it.
mkdir Attempt6
## I went into it
cd $SCRATCH/Homework01/Q2/Attempt6
## I copied the Scer3.fa file into it
cp $SCRATCH/Homework01/Q2/Scer3.fa $SCRATCH/Homework01/Q2/Attempt6
## This code split the file based on the ">" symbol being there at the beginning of each sequence label.
csplit -k Scer3.fa '/^>/' {*}
## I checked each file manually and copied down the label of the sequence.
nano xx00
nano xx01
nano xx02
nano xx03
nano xx04
nano xx05
nano xx06
nano xx07
nano xx08
nano xx09
nano xx10
nano xx11
nano xx12
nano xx13
nano xx14
nano xx15
nano xx16
nano xx17
## I found 17 sequence labels.
##Their names were/are chr1, chrII, chrIII, chrIV, chrV, chrVI, chrVII,chrVIII,chrIX, chrX,chrXI,chrXII,chrXIII,chrXIV, chrXV,chrXVI & chrM.


### 3. How many genes are annotated in the Scer3.gff file? 

awk '{print $3}' Scer3.gff > forcedawkintotextfile.txt

##If you are looking for the number of mention of genes.
grep -o -c gene forcedawkintotextfile.txt
##The above command selected for the lines that match the word given above "gene".
## The number of genes in the file (outputted by the program) is 6716.



### 4. How many different features are provided in the Scer3.gff file?

## The meaning of features is unclear here. If it means the labels for the types of genetic information they found the following commands were useful.

sort -u forcedawkintotextfile.txt > sortedFILEawkCommand.txt
##Above I sorted for what is unique.
wc -l sortedFILEawkCommand.txt
##Above I counted the number of lines.

##There are 36 different features that are mentioned in this file.
